Epylog is a syslog parser which runs periodically,
looks at your logs, processes some of the entries
in order to present them in a more comprehensible format,
and then mails you the output.
It is written specifically for large network clusters
where a lot of machines (around 50 and upwards) log to the
same loghost using syslog or syslog-ng.
It is an alternative to a similar package, called LogWatch.

The epylog engine should work on most unix systems running
Python-2.2 and above, although currently the processing modules
are only written to work with linux (and particularly Red Hat Linux
series 7 and above).
However, other unix and linux flavors should work fine,
as long as they use standard logging facilities and things like PAM.
